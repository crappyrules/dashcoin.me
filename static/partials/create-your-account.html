    Below this you will find your thirteen word "Private Login Key". Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it is
    the only way that you will be able to login to your {{config.platformName}} account. As we don't store your private login key on the server
    there is no way to recover it if it is lost!<br><br>Your private login key can also never be changed, and if it is stolen or otherwise
    compromised, you will have to move your funds to a new account with a new private login key. Therefore, it is best that you
    backup your private login key by writing it down, perhaps obscuring it as part of a poem or letter, and storing it in multiple
    safe and secure places.

      <div class="no-account-text thin middle">
    {{config.platformName}} is a web-based interface that allows you to use {{config.coinName}} without running a full {{config.coinName}} node. However, because this convenience
    comes at a cost: it is extremely difficult for {{config.platformName}} to securely deliver its code to your browser. This means that there is
    considerable risk in using {{config.platformName}} for large amounts!<br><br>It is recommended that you treat {{config.platformName}} as you would treat your
    actual wallet, and not store very large amounts in it. For long-term storage of {{config.coinName}} you should create a cold wallet.
